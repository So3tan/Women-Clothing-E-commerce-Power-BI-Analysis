# Women-Clothing-E-commerce-Power-BI-Analysis

Overview
This project explores a real-world dataset of 22,641 customer reviews from a women’s clothing e-commerce platform. Using Excel, I built an interactive dashboard that visualizes key trends in product reviews, recommendations, and customer preferences across departments, age groups, and product categories.

Tools & Skills Used
Microsoft Excel
Pivot Tables
Slicers for filtering by age group, department, rating, etc.
Data cleaning & transformation
Bar, pie, and combo charts for storytelling

Insights Gained
The Tops department received the highest number of reviews.
Dresses and Knits were the most recommended clothing classes.
Reviews rated “Best” (5 stars) were most frequent, with strong correlation to product recommendations.
Seniors and Teenagers tended to give slightly higher average ratings.
The General division had the highest volume of positive feedback, especially for Tops.
